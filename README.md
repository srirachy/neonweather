# Weather Forecast React Project

## Description
This project has the following requirements:
- App should use ESLint with the Airbnb style guide and Prettier
- App should have the following `devDependencies` installed: `eslint eslint-config-airbnb eslint-config-node eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-node eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks prettier`
- App should contain `.eslintignore`, `.eslintrc.json`, and `.prettierrc` files in the root directory.
- App should contain a functional error boundary that displays an alternate UI in case of component error.
- Each component that receives props must have React PropTypes and DefaultProps.
- App should have passing component tests for at least two of the main components. Any utility functions should have thorough unit test coverage.
- Upon initial render, app should load a weekly weather forecast for a chosen default location.
- The user should be able to enter either a city/state, a zip code, and address, or a landmark for their search term. If the weather API relies on a lat/lng for search, use a geocoder to convert the human-friendly search into location co-ordinates.
- Each component's props should be destructured for component readability.
- Pull data from an external API using `axios`, `fetch`, or a similar tool.
- Hide any API keys using a `.env.local` file.
- App should have multiple components. Use props to pass data from parent components into child components to allow customization of the child components.
- Code should be as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) as possible!

This project utilizes JS and React to run.
